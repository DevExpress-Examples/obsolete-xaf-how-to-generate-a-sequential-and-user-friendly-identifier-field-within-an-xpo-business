# XAF - How to Generate a Sequential User-friendly Identifier Field (XPO)

This example illustrates one of the possible approaches to implement a user-friendlyÂ identifier field with sequential values in an XPO business class.

## Example for EF Core 

Looking for EF Core information instead of XPO? The following example shows how to implement a similar functionality in an XAF application that uses EF Core:

## Scenario

Orders, articles, or other business entities often require that you have user-friendly **Id** or **Code** fields that end-users can memorize and use during phone conversations. They are usually sequential, but some gaps can be allowed as well, for example, when an order is deleted. Refer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5924499/"><u>this StackOverFlow thread</u></a> for more information on this common scenario and a possible implementation.

## Implementation Details

1. Add a new business class to the **YourSolutionName.Module** project.


2. In the `OnSaving` method, call the static `DevExpress.Persistent.BaseImpl.DistributedIdGeneratorHelper.Generate` method. Refer to the following file for an example: [TestUserFriendlyCodeObject](CS/SequentalGenerator/SequentalGenerator.Module/BusinessObjects/TestUserFriendlyCodeObject.cs)

   Depending on your business requirements, you can implement a readonly persistent or editable property where the generated value will be stored. You can also perform various checks before you generate the next sequence, such as:
   
   * `string.IsNullOrEmpty(currentSequenceProperty)`. Avoids double assignments.
   
   * `Session.IsNewObject(this)`. Checks whether the object is new.
   
   * `!(Session is NestedUnitOfWork)`. ChecksÂ whether the object is being saved to the database and not to the parent session.
   
   * Security system checks as per this blog post [about Session.DataLayer property](http://dennisgaravsky.blogspot.com/2013/03/beware-of-sessiondatalayer-in-middle.html). 

   > **Note**
   > You can use any strings as the `seqType` and `serverPrefix` (optional) parameters that allow you to run named sequences inÂ parallel. These parameters determine criteria forÂ updating right sequences. The demo uses the full persistent type name and a custom prefix that you can change:

## Additional Information

  
1. The `DistributedIdGeneratorHelper` class demonstrated in this solution creates the **IDGeneratorTable** table to store the information about the last sequential number of a type. You can find more information on how this works from its source code atÂ _C:\Program Files\DevExpress 2X.X\Components\Sources\DevExpress.Persistent\DevExpress.Persistent.BaseImpl.Xpo\IDGenerator.cs_. 


2. If you have validation rules for your business class, theÂ `OnSaving` method (and thus the sequence generation) is called only after all validation is passed. However, in rare cases,Â if a database related error is thrown during the first save and then the form is re-saved, the`OnSaving` method may be called again and a new sequence can be generated. This may lead to gaps inÂ sequential numbers, which is not always allowed by business requirements (e.g., government regulations). To avoid this, you can use a more complicated solution from theÂ [How to generate and assign a sequential number for a business object within a database transaction, while being a part of a successful saving process (XAF)](https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E2829)Â example or implement a database-level solution to handle such situations, for example, using triggers. 

3. In the [Integrated Mode](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113436/data-security-and-safety/security-system/security-tiers/2-tier-security-integrated-mode-and-ui-level)Â andÂ [Middle Tier Application Server](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113439/data-security-and-safety/security-system/security-tiers/middle-tier-security) scenarios, the newly generated sequence number will appear in the DetailView only after a manual refresh, because the sequence is generated on the server side only and is not passed to the client. For additional information, refer to the following section of the KB article: [Refresh the Identifier field value in UI](https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/T567184).

4. You can specify the initial sequence value manually. Use either of the following ways: 
   
   * Edit theÂ **IDGeneratorTable** table in the database.
   * Manipulate theÂ `DevExpress.Persistent.BaseImpl.OidGenerator` objects. For additional information, refer to the [Create, Read, Update and Delete Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113711/data-manipulation-and-business-logic/create-read-update-and-delete-data) article about data manipulation in XPO/EF Core-based solutions.
   * Use a different server prefix to start numbering with 1 again. For example, "2017" or "2018".
