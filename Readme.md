This example illustrates one of the possible approaches to implement a user-friendly identifier field with sequential values in an XPO business class.

## Example for EF Core 

Looking for EF Core information instead of XPO? The following example shows how to implement a similar functionality in an XAF application that uses EF Core:

## Scenario

Orders, articles, or other business entities often require that you have user-friendly **Id** or **Code** fields that end-users can memorize and use during phone conversations. They are usually sequential, but some gaps can be allowed as well, for example, when an order is deleted. Refer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5924499/"><u>this StackOverFlow thread</u></a> for more information on this common scenario and a possible implementation.

## Implementation Details

1. Add a new business class to your platform-agnostic module.

2. In the `OnSaving` method, call the static `DevExpress.Persistent.BaseImpl.DistributedIdGeneratorHelper.Generate` method. 

   Depending on your business requirements, you can implement a readonly persistent or editable property where the generated value will be stored. You can also perform various checks before you generate the next sequence, such as:
   
   * `string.IsNullOrEmpty(currentSequenceProperty)`. Avoids double assignments.
   
   * `Session.IsNewObject(this)`. Checks whether the object is new.
   
   * `!(Session is NestedUnitOfWork)`. Checks whether the object is being saved to the database and not to the parent session.
   
   * Security system checks as per this blog post [about Session.DataLayer property](http://dennisgaravsky.blogspot.com/2013/03/beware-of-sessiondatalayer-in-middle.html). 

   > **Note**
   > You can use any strings as the `seqType` and `serverPrefix` (optional) parameters that allow you to run named sequences in parallel. These parameters determine criteria for updating right sequences. The demo uses the full persistent type name and a custom prefix that you can change:

4. Build your platform-agnostic project and double-click on the _Solution2.Module\Module.xx_ file to invoke the [Module Designer](http://documentation.devexpress.com/#Xaf/CustomDocument2828). 

5. Refer to the **Exported Types** section within the designer and expand the **Referenced Assemblies | DevExpress.Persistent.BaseImpl** node. 

6. Select the **OidGenerator** node and press the space bar to include this persistent type into the business model of your module:

## Additional information
  
1. The `DistributedIdGeneratorHelper` class demonstrated in this solution creates the **IDGeneratorTable** table to store the information about the last sequential number of a type. You can learn more on how this works from its source code at _C:\Program Files (x86)\DevExpress 1X.X\Components\Sources\DevExpress.Persistent\DevExpress.Persistent.BaseImpl\IDGenerator.cs_. 

   This particular solution uses built-in XAF classes and is simpler to implement and maintain than the [How to generate and assign a sequential number for a business object within a database transaction, while being a part of a successful saving process (XAF)](https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E2829) example. Nevertheless, it is pretty safe and should also work in the most typical business scenarios.

2. If you have validation rules for your business class, the `OnSaving` method (and thus the sequence generation) is called only after all validation is passed. However, in rare cases, if a database related error is thrown during the first save and then the form is re-saved, the`OnSaving` method may be called again and a new sequence can be generated. This may lead to gaps in sequential numbers, which is not always allowed by business requirements (e.g., government regulations). To avoid this, you can use a more complicated solution from the [How to generate and assign a sequential number for a business object within a database transaction, while being a part of a successful saving process (XAF)](https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E2829) example or implement a database-level solution to handle such situations, for example, using triggers. 

3. In the [Integrated Mode](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113436/data-security-and-safety/security-system/security-tiers/2-tier-security-integrated-mode-and-ui-level) and [Middle Tier Application Server](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113439/data-security-and-safety/security-system/security-tiers/middle-tier-security) scenarios, the newly generated sequence number will appear in the DetailView only after a manual refresh, because the sequence is generated on the server side only and is not passed to the client. For additional information, refer to the following section of the KB article: [Refresh the Identifier field value in UI](https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/T567184).

4. You can find functional [EasyTest](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113211/debugging-testing-and-error-handling/functional-tests-easy-test) scripts for this scenario in the _Solution2.Module\FunctionalTests\E4904.ets_ file. 

5. You can specify the initial sequence value manually. Use either of the following ways: 
   
   * Edit the **IDGeneratorTable** table in the database.
   * Manipulate the `DevExpress.Persistent.BaseImpl.OidGenerator` objects. For additional information, refer to the [Create, Read, Update and Delete Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113711/data-manipulation-and-business-logic/create-read-update-and-delete-data) article about data manipulation in XPO/EF Core-based solutions.
   * Use a different server prefix to start numbering with 1 again. For example, "2017" or "2018".
